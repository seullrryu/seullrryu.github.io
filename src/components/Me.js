            I am a graduate of New York University with a B.A in Computer
            Science, along with a minor in Web Programming and Applications. I
            am currently an Senior Associate Software Engineer at Capital One.

            Even though I am passionate about all sides of software development,
            I am especially passionate about front end development and UI
            design. I love how users can visually and physically interact with
            my code and development. As a Software Engineer, I value simple code
            structure and meaningful interactions.

            When I am not developing, you can see me playing soccer in the fields of NYC or engaging in various debates about NBA, NFL and Soccer. Shoot me a message if you want to talk about Manchester
            United or Brooklyn Nets!
